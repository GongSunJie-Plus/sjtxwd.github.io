<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics (Chinese Pinyin: shxue; Greek: Mu alpha theta_mu alpha_kappa; English: Mathematics or Maths), originated from the ancient Greek language of Mu theta_mu (mthma), which has the meaning of learning, learning and science. Ancient Greek scholars regarded it as the starting point of philosophy and the basis of learning. In addition, there is a more narrow and technical significance - "mathematical research". Even within its etymology, its adjective meanings, which are related to learning, will also be used in exponential learning. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its plural form in English and its plural form + es in French can be traced back to the Latin neutral plural (Mathematica), which was translated by Cicero from the Greek plural alphata mathmatik. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient China, mathematics was called arithmetic, also known as arithmetic, and finally changed to mathematics. In ancient China, arithmetic was one of the six arts (called "number" in the six arts). </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics originated from the early productive activities of human beings. The Babylonians have accumulated certain knowledge of mathematics since ancient times and can apply practical problems. From the point of view of mathematics itself, their knowledge of mathematics is only the result of observation and experience, without comprehensive conclusions and proofs, but they should also fully affirm what they have done about mathematics. Contribution. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge and application of basic mathematics is an indispensable part of individual and group life. The refinement of its basic concepts can be seen in ancient mathematics texts in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and ancient India. Since then, its development has continued to make small progress. But algebra and geometry at that time. Learning has long been independent. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Algebra can be said to be the most widely accepted "mathematics". It can be said that from childhood, everyone began to learn mathematics, the index contact with mathematics is algebra. Mathematics as a study of "numbers", algebra is also one of the most important components of mathematics. Geometry is the earliest start by people. The branch of mathematics that studies. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not until the Renaissance of the 16th century that Descartes created analytical geometry, linking algebras and geometry, which were completely separated at that time. Since then, we have finally been able to prove the theorems of geometry by calculation; at the same time, we can use graphics to represent abstract algebraic equations visually. Later, more refined algebraic equations have been developed. Micro calculus. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays mathematics has many branches. The Bulbachi School, founded in France in the 1930s, holds that mathematics, at least pure mathematics, is a theory for studying Abstract structures. Structure is a deductive system based on initial concepts and axioms. They hold that mathematics has three basic parent structures: algebraic structures. (Groups, Rings, Domains, Lattices...) Ordered structure (partial order, total order...) Topological Structure (Neighborhood, Limit, Connectivity, Dimension...) .[1] </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics has been applied in many different fields, including science, engineering, medicine and economics. Mathematics application in these fields is generally called applied mathematics. Sometimes, it also arouses new mathematical discoveries and promotes the development of new mathematical disciplines. Mathematicians also study pure mathematics, that is, mathematics itself. What is the goal of practical application? Although many works begin with pure mathematics, they may find suitable applications later. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, it is useful to explore the sub-fields of the connection between the core of mathematics and other fields: from logic, set theory (mathematical basis), empirical mathematics (applied mathematics) in different sciences, and more recent studies of uncertainty (chaos, fuzzy mathematics). </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Longitudinally speaking, the exploration in the respective fields of mathematics is also more and more in-depth.

English Development and Source Evolution Map 	</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old English is greatly influenced by low Germanic languages, such as verbs, basic vocabulary, pronunciation, compound word structure and complex morphological changes, but it is still very different from modern standard German. Modern English does not originate or evolve from Roman or French, but tens of thousands of modern English vocabulary, a large part of which comes from French, and about 50,000 English vocabulary are close to or exactly the same as French. Modern English and most modern European languages have changed to alphabetical spelling. 
	</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1066, William I, the Duke of Normandy, who ruled northwest of the Kingdom of France, conquered the Kingdom of England and became King of England. All the British nobles were replaced by French and intermarried with the nobles of France. During the more than three hundred years of the Norman Conquest, the monarchs and nobles of the Kingdom of England spoke French, while the clergy used Latin and Middle English. 
	</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern English		</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 1500, Middle English evolved into Modern English. 
The spelling letters used in modern English are also completely borrowed from 26 letters. The so-called "English alphabet" is the spelling letter used by ancient Romans in writing. English began to use the Latin alphabet as a spelling system around the sixth century A.D. in Anglo-Saxon times. The missionaries introduced letters in order to record the local language into words. The problem they faced was that there were more than 40 different pronunciations in English at that time, but the Latin letters could not correspond to each other. So they used the methods of adding letters, adding mutants to letters, and connecting two letters to correspond to different pronunciations. Later, a system of 26 Latin letters plus & with some spelling rules was formed in Old English.

	<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer science (sometimes abbreviated as CS) is the theoretical basis of systematic research on information and computing and the practical technology of how they are implemented and applied in computer systems. It is often described as a systematic study of algorithmic processing for creating, describing and transforming information. Computer science embraces many branches; some emphasize the calculation of specific results, such as computer graphics; some explore the nature of computing problems, such as computational complexity theory; and some focus on how to implement computing, such as programming language theory is the method of describing computing, while programming It is the application of specific programming languages to solve specific computing problems, while human-computer interaction focuses on how to make computers and computing useful, easy to use, and anytime, anywhere for people to use. [1] </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes the public mistakenly think that computer science is the cause of solving computer problems (such as information technology), or that it is only related to the experience of using computers, such as playing games, surfing the Internet or word processing. In fact, computer science focuses not only on understanding the nature of programs that implement software like games and browsers, but also on creating new programs or improving existing ones through existing knowledge. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer is a kind of machine for arithmetic and logic operation, and there are communication problems for systems connected by several computers, and the object of processing is information. Therefore, computer science is the science of information processing. Computer science consists of theoretical computer science and experimental computer science. Computer Science in mathematical literature generally refers to theoretical computer science. Experimental computer science also includes research on opening up new areas of computer applications. [1] </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the research in computer science is based on Von Neumann computers and Turing machines, which are the computational models of most real machines. As the founder of this model, Church-Turing Thesis shows that although there may be differences in computing time and space efficiency, existing computing devices have the same computing power. Although this theory is generally considered the basis of computer science, scientists also study other kinds of machines, such as parallel computers at the practical level and probabilistic computers, Oracle computers and quantum computers at the theoretical level. In this sense, computers are just a computing tool: a famous computer scientist, Dijkstra, has a famous saying: "Computer science pays less attention to computers than astronomy to telescopes."</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a discipline, computer science covers from the theoretical research and computational limits of algorithms to how to implement computational systems through hardware and software. CSAB (formerly known as Computing Sciences Accreditation Board) is composed of representatives of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE Computer Society (IEEE-CS). It establishes four main fields of computer science: computing theory, algorithms and data structures, programming methods and programming languages, and design. Computer Elements and Architecture. CSAB also establishes other important areas, such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, computer networks and communications, database systems, parallel computing, distributed computing, human-computer interaction, machine translation, computer graphics, operating systems, and numerical and symbolic computing.

	<p style="font-size: 20px">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports is a complex social and cultural phenomenon. It takes physical and intellectual activities as the basic means, and according to the law of human growth and development, skill formation and function improvement, it achieves the goal of promoting overall development, improving physical quality and overall education level, enhancing physical fitness and sports ability, improving lifestyle and improving quality of life. A conscious, purposeful and organized social activity of quantity. With the expansion of international exchanges, the scale and level of sports development has become an important symbol of the development and progress of a country and society, as well as an important means of diplomatic and cultural exchanges between countries. Sports can be divided into mass sports, professional sports, school sports and other types. Including sports culture, sports education, sports activities, sports competitions, sports facilities, sports organizations, sports science and technology and many other elements. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The human body is an organic whole composed of various organ systems. When doing sports, it seems that only the muscles are moving. In fact, the body's breathing, blood circulation and other organs are participating in activities, and must be directed and coordinated by the cerebral cortex. Preparatory activity is to increase the excitement of nerve cells in the greater cortex. Preparatory activity can also slightly increase body temperature, keep muscles and tendons in good condition, and have good elasticity and extensibility. It is not necessary to pull or tear because of sudden contraction. This is especially important in winter. When throwing, such as hand grenades, shot putts, solid balls, javelins, softball and so on, we must act according to the teacher's command, order and prohibit them, and there must be no carelessness.
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the adjustment and upgrading of China's industrial structure, sports industry plays an increasingly prominent role in promoting economic development. In 2010, the General Office of the State Council issued the Guiding Opinion of the General Office of the State Council on Accelerating the Development of Sports Industry (No. 22, 2010), which affirmed the important role of sports industry in the social economy from the national policy level, and defined the basic principles, main objectives and key tasks of the development of sports industry. The promulgation of the Guiding Opinions marked the beginning of the transformation of the sports industry into a state-led way, in which all departments and the whole society jointly promote development. Following the promulgation of the Guiding Opinions, local sports industry policies have been issued one after another. The establishment of sports industry development guidance funds and the implementation of various financial and tax preferential policies of sports enterprises will effectively promote the development of local sports industry in China. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, the General Administration of Sports issued the 12th Five-Year Plan for Sports Industry. 
Sports demeanour 
Sports demeanour (12 sheets) 
This is the index Five-Year Plan for China's sports industry, which refines the development goals, main tasks and main measures of the sports industry during the "Twelfth Five-Year Plan". For the index time, the plan clearly put forward the quantitative indicators for the development of sports industry, and the added value of sports industry in the 12th Five-Year Plan increased at an average rate of more than 110% per year. By the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan, the added value of sports industry exceeded 400 billion yuan, accounting for more than 0.7% of GDP, more than 4 million employees and sports products. Industry has become one of the important growth points of the national economy. With the strong support of national policy, industrial policy and local policy, the sports industry will show tremendous growth. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports industry is an important part of modern service industry, is a new economic growth point and an important carrier to promote social employment. Sports industry has become internationally recognized as the most dynamic industry in the 21st century. It is a sunrise industry, health industry and green industry with high permeability, cross-cutting and pulling. Sports industry is a pillar industry in developed countries. In North America, Western Europe and Japan, the annual output value of sports industry ranks among the top ten industries in the country. Although the history of sports industrialization is less than a hundred years, its development speed is much faster than other industries. It grows at the rate of 20% annually, and the proportion of output value in GDP is less than 1%, which is nearly 10 times lower than that of developed countries in Europe and the United States. Under the favorable macroeconomic environment in China, with the increase of per capita income, leisure time, the upgrade of sports consumption and the publication of Guidelines for Accelerating the Development of Sports Industry, it is believed that China's sports industry will usher in a golden stage of development. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Data show that after more than 20 years of market-oriented attempts, China's sports industry has achieved rapid development in the process of scale. In 2011, the sports industry showed a prosperous development. The total revenue of sponsorship for the 26th Summer Universiade reached 1.227 billion yuan. The Italian Super Cup attracted nearly 80,000 people to the Bird's Nest, and ticket revenue alone exceeded 100 million yuan.
